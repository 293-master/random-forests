PS8 lite: Random Forests
================

## What’s due when?

1.  By **Friday 4/17 9pm Eastern** (note evening due time) you must
    submit all your work on GitHub.

## Your work

1.  You will make one submission to Kaggle using Random Forests using
    any method of your choice.
2.  This problem is very short and straightforward, so there will be no
    groups.
3.  Also, to minimize cognitive load, you will use the same data and
    model formula as in PS7 on LASSO.

## Evaluation criteria

1.  **“If others can’t reproduce your work, they will throw it in the
    trash.”** Submissions that don’t knit will be penalized harshly.
2.  **“Presentation and communication-style matters.”** Related to point
    above, for example
      - Plots: Keep the “ink-to-information” ratio in mind. Ensure your
        plots have labeled axes and informative titles.
      - Use markdown formatting to make your presentation effective.
      - Is code cleanly written, well-documented, and well-formatted. As
        the semester progresses, I’ll be giving feedback from [The
        tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).
3.  As long as you make one valid submission to Kaggle using any Random
    Forest, you are good.
